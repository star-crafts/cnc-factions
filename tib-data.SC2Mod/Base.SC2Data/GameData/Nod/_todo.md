<!-- Tech Lab. Decoy Temple. Deploys a decoy of the Temple of Nod at the selected location. The decoy has no abilities of its own, but has the identical appearance and armour of the real structure. It creates a timer for the Nuclear Missile Strike just like the real structure (even though it is fake), and when both the real and decoy versions are built, these timers will appear alongside each other, confusing enemies. -->
<!-- NodTemple.Nuclear Missile.Launches a devastating nuclear missile to the target location. -->
<!-- NodTemple. Master Computer Countermeasures. Cancels the effects of EMP blasts from all player-owned buildings and restores the radar display. -->
<!-- === OC
Decoy Army
Creates a holographic projection of a selected group of units. These units can be controlled as any other and can uncover the fog of war, but do not deal damage and vapourize instantly when fired upon or if one minute is elapsed since their creation.

Radar Jamming Missile
Temporarily disables the radar displays of all enemy players.

Cloaking Field
Cloaks selected friendly mechanical units. Instantly kills infantry, while base factions’ heavy infantry (Zone Troopers, Black Hand Troopers, and Shock Troopers) only get 25% of that damage.

Power Signature Scan
Reveals the locations of all Power Plants and Reactors on the map for 10 seconds. -->

===Armageddon Ability
Mine Drop
Drops a 21-piece minefield to a target location by an Armageddon Bomber.

Magnetic Mine Drop
Drops a 21-piece magnetic minefield to a target location by an Armageddon Bomber. Magnetic mines deal significantly less damage than the mines from vanilla Nod Mine Drops and GDI’s Guardian APCs, but are able to slow down vehicles.

Seed Tiberium
Calls an Armageddon Bomber to spray quickly-crystallizing liquid Tiberium over a selected area to create a small Tiberium field worth $3150.

Tiberium Vapour Bomb
Calls an Armageddon Bomber to drop a toxic cloud to a target area, which then explodes and damages everything in its wake.


===Chemical Plant
Catalyst Missile
Agitates any Tiberium within Tiberium-based units and structures in the target area (Harvesters, Refineries, Silos, Tiberium Waste Facilities, charged Devourer Tanks and Reaper Tripods, Corrupters, Mechapedes).

Tiberium Vein Detonation
Causes the targeted permanent Tiberium field to violently explode, dealing considerable damage to all units found on it, as well as Tiberium crystals themselves. After that, eight damage paths are created from the center of the blast (which will even affect units which try to evade it), as well as a shockwave at the center. Units at the center take less damage than those caught by damage paths.
